Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method used in algorithm design and computer science to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the same subproblems are solved multiple times. Instead of solving the same problem repeatedly, dynamic programming solves each subproblem just once and stores the results for future use. This approach reduces the computational overhead and improves efficiency.

### Key Concepts in Dynamic Programming

1. **Overlapping Subproblems**:
   - Problems can be broken down into smaller, simpler subproblems, which are solved independently.
   - These subproblems often overlap, meaning the same subproblem is solved multiple times.

2. **Optimal Substructure**:
   - An optimal solution to the problem can be constructed efficiently from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
   - This property ensures that the solution of a problem consists of the solutions to its subproblems.

3. **Memoization**:
   - This technique involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.
   - Typically implemented using a table (array or hash map).

4. **Tabulation**:
   - This technique involves solving subproblems in a bottom-up manner, storing results in a table, and building up to the final solution.

### Example: Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example where dynamic programming can be applied. The naive recursive solution has a lot of redundant calculations:

```javascript
function fib(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```

This recursive approach has an exponential time complexity because it recalculates the same values many times. We can improve it using dynamic programming:

#### Memoization Approach

```javascript
function fib(n, memo = {}) {
    if (n in memo) {
        return memo[n];
    }
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
    return memo[n];
}
```

#### Tabulation Approach

```javascript
function fib(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    let fibTable = [0, 1];
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        fibTable[i] = fibTable[i - 1] + fibTable[i - 2];
    }
    return fibTable[n];
}
```

### When to Use Dynamic Programming

- Use DP when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.
- Look for optimal substructure in the problem, where the global optimal solution can be derived from local optimal solutions.
- DP is particularly useful for problems involving sequences, such as longest common subsequence, shortest paths in graphs, and knapsack problems.

### Conclusion

Dynamic Programming is a powerful technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, reusable subproblems. It involves two main approaches: memoization and tabulation, both of which help in reducing the overall time complexity of algorithms by avoiding redundant calculations.
